## Success Measures

### Initial project research

- Research about Kubernetes and Kubernetes deployment
- Research about Raspberry Pi
- Configure remote access to the Raspberry Pi

By the end of this success measure, team members are more familiar with the technology that we will be using in this
project.

### Set up Kubernetes

- Install and configure Docker and Kubernetes
- Create pods within Kubernetes

By the end of this success measure, we should be able to deploy Kubernetes pods manually.

### Configure Kubernetes UI/Dashboard

- Install custom solutions for better management of clusters and viewing cluster status

By the end of this success measure, team members will be able to manage the cluster from the management portal instead
of through a CLI.

### Develop a pipeline (part 1)

- User is able to go into the dashboard and submit a project with a config file

By the end of this success measure, users should be able to submit a config file to the pipeline.

### Develop a pipeline (part 2)

- User is able to view uploaded project
- User should be able to see the pod status after successful deployment

By the end of this success measure, a user should be able to successfully launch their application.

### Public facing

- Userâ€™s project is able to receive traffic outside of the Raspberry Pi network

By the end of this success measure, public users should be able to access and make use of the deployed application.
