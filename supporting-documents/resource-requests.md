# Resource Requests

---

## Resources needed

- Time: we require time to research some of the services we will be using to implement this project. This should be done
  by the end of the term. Services being researched:
  - Kubernetes
  - Docker
  - Frontend/Backend Web framework exploration for management site

- Additional Pis: The original goal of the project was to deploy Kubernetes across multiple Raspberry Pis. However, we
  currently only have one Pi. We may need additional Raspberry Pis beyond our current one if the project becomes too
  resource-intensive to run on a single Pi. If additional Pis end up being required, we will need a network switch and
  patch cables to network all of the Pis together.

  We will not be sure if multiple are necessary until later in the term when we start deployment of applications into
  Kubernetes, and will request additional resources at that time.

## Resource sources

Additional resources will be provided by our project partner and will be low cost -- under $200 in total for all
required equipment to manage multiple Pis.

## Procurement timeline

We have allocated the minimum required resources for the project. We believe that any additional resources that are
required for the stretch goals portion of the project can be requested through our project partner.
