## Problem Statement

The objective of this capstone project is to build a workflow pipeline that can take a user-specified config file and
launch a containerized Docker application using Kubernetes on a cluster of several Raspberry Pi computers. This allows
the user to utilize a powerful system that can deploy web applications, machine learning, or any application to their
choosing with a lower operating cost compared to industry solutions. By utilizing a Raspberry Pi cluster, the user can
expect to be able to scale their workflow in either software or hardware. The user should also expect to be able to
access their deployment through a website portal outside of the local network. This capstone project is targeted towards
startups, researchers, and other groups of individuals that are looking to reduce their operating costs and reliance on
cloud giants.

## Existing Systems and Conditions

Currently, the primary solutions are cloud-based services such as AWS, Microsoft Azure, or Google Cloud. While useful in
many contexts, the proposed solution would be cheaper in the long term for smaller services. While a Raspberry Pi
cluster would have a one-time initial purchase for the hardware, cloud-based services would have a larger total cost, as
there are recurring operational charges based on the computing power used.

This project will use the Docker containerization service alongside the Kubernetes container orchestration system to
create a cluster on Raspberry Pis. Our project partner will be providing us with a Raspberry Pi with which to complete
this project.

## Motivation

The project partner is looking for alternative solutions to reduce their reliance on industry solutions and create a
similar solution with a local Raspberry Pi cluster instead of servers.

## List of Terms

*Docker*
: A containerization platform that packages software in a lightweight, isolated, and portable environment called a
  container. <https://www.docker.com/>

*Kubernetes*
: An open-source container-orchestration system for automating computer application development, scaling, and
  management. <https://kubernetes.io/>

*Pipeline*
: A set of automated processes that allow developers to reliably and efficiently compile, build, and deploy their code
  to their production compute platforms.

*Raspberry Pi*
: A low cost, credit-card sized computer that plugs into a computer monitor or TV, and uses a standard keyboard and
  mouse. <https://www.raspberrypi.org/>
