# Kubernetes On The Edge

This project utilizes Kubernetes, Docker, and a Raspberry Pi. 

## 1. Abstract and principal members: 

This project will containerize your code with Docker and deploy it with Kuberenetes with the deployment pipeline that we have created to run on a Raspberry Pi. 
- Robert Detjens, worked on deployment pipeline.
- Jacob Balin, worked on the kubernetes templates.
- Nathan Hausman, worked on the deployment UI website that connected the website with the deployment pipeline.
- Mark Ser, worked on setting up the Raspberry Pi and getting the Kubernetes dashboard working. 
- Paul Lim, also worked on a portion of the deployment pipeline.
- Kyle Prouty (Project Partner), helped scope the project, provided the equipment, and more.

## 7: Conclusions and Reflections (each team member answers all questions individually)

- What technical information did you learn?
    - A lot about Kubernetes and how to deploy a kubeneretes dashboard outside of the cluster's IP (Mark).
    - I learned a lot about Kubernetes. Specifically how to properly configure the deployment and service aspects of Kubernetes (Jacob). 
- What non-technical information did you learn?
    - How to write a scope paper (Mark).
    - I learned how to project manage and coordinate with a team of developers, as well as some of the technical writing and presentation skills that are required for a project such as this one (Jacob).
- What have you learned about project work?
    - Start working on it ealier in the week so that people have time throughout the week to do code reviews (Mark).
    - Having a solid and realistic plan of action is important before starting to work on a project. It is useful to have direction and clear goals while working on a project such as this (Jacob).
- What have you learned about project management?
    - It requires alot of work up front to have it easier later on (Mark).
    - Coordinating between a team even as small as ours has its challenges. It is important to have a project management tool (we used Trello) to keep track of one's tasks and responsibilities (Jacob).
- What have you learned about working in teams?
    - Have good project management with the team or have one person be good at it (Mark).
    - It is important to have frequent communication with your team and to hold each other accountable for deliverables and deadlines. It is also important that each member of the team keeps on top of their responsibilities with the project management tool or project manager (Jacob).
- If you could do it all over, what would you do differently?
    - Start coding earlier (Mark)!
    - I would have more team and project partener meetings. I would get to know my team a lot sooner than I did and become comfortable with them earlier on than I did (Jacob).

## 8: Future Direction

- User login for the deployment website
- Automatic token injection for the dashboard website
- AI task workflow kickoff
- Exposing multiple ports via ingress controllers
