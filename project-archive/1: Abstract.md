# Kubernetes On The Edge

## Abstract

This project utilizes Kubernetes, Docker, and a Raspberry Pi to create a simple
and easy to use Kubernetes deployment pipeline for edge computing with Raspberry
Pis.

The goal of the project is to create a deployment pipeline for containerized
applications on Raspberry Pi devices. With this pipeline, users should expect to
be able to have their application containerized and deployed onto a Kubernetes
Cluster. This cluster will be hosted on a Raspberry Pi to allow for affordable
scaling of hardware resources with the addition of more Pis.
